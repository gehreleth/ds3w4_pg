#Peer reviewed assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data course.

This tidy dataset contains training and test subsets of data taken from wearable smartphones' accelerometer and gyroscope sensors. Each measurement contains activity, testing subject and two three dimensional vector values: mean and standard derivation for each activity and testing subject. Accelleration is given in standard accelleration units (in g). Gyroscope measurement units are radians/second.  

The columns are:

* Subject testing subject (1-20)
* Activity activity being observed (LAYING, SITTING, STANDING, WALKING, WALKINGDOWNSTAIRS, WALKINGUPSTAIRS)
* BodyAccelerationMeanX accellerometer's mean X
* BodyAccelerationMeanY accellerometer's mean Y
* BodyAccelerationMeanZ accellerometer's mean Z
* BodyAccelerationStdDerivationX accellerometer's standard derivation X
* BodyAccelerationStdDerivationY accellerometer's standard derivation Y
* BodyAccelerationStdDerivationZ accellerometer's standard derivation Z
* BodyGyroscopeMeanX gyroscope's mean X
* BodyGyroscopeMeanY gyroscope's mean Y
* BodyGyroscopeMeanZ gyroscope's mean Z
* BodyGyroscopeStdDerivationX's gyroscope standard derivation X
* BodyGyroscopeStdDerivationY's gyroscope standard derivation Y
* BodyGyroscopeStdDerivationZ's gyroscope standard derivation Z
